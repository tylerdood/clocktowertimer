The timer controls can be found on the right, allowing to you start, stop, reset, edit, and quick adjust the current time. To recall the town immediately (stopping the timer) you can press the Recall Townsfolk button. You can advance to the next phase by pressing the \"Wake Up\" button. Switching to end of day (nomination phase) will automatically shorten the timer. The timer will also be shortened when advancing the days (to account for fewer alive people as the game progresses). Hope you enjoy!",
